# Enumerable_Methods

Advanced Building Blocks

This project is an implementation of Custom Enumerable methods. To name a few, these are the methods created
and implemented: 'my_each', 'my_each_with_index', 'my_select', 'my_all?', 'my_any?', 'my_none?', 'my_count',
'my_map', 'my_inject' and a 'multiply_els' method which also implemented the my-inject method.

The project is part of a series of projects to be completed by students of [Microverse](https://www.microverse.org/ "The Global School for Remote Software Developers!").
